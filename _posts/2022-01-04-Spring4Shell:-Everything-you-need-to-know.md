A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.

Spring WebFlux is a fully non-blocking, annotation-based web framework built on Project Reactor that makes it possible to build reactive applications on the HTTP layer. WebFlux uses a new router functions feature to apply functional programming to the web layer and bypass declarative controllers and RequestMappings.

To understand how to Build Web Api's or Web Applications in Spring [Read this article](https://howtodoinjava.com/spring-webflux/spring-webflux-tutorial/#:~:text=What%20is%20Spring%20WebFlux%20%3F,easily%20work%20on%20webflux%20also.)



## Prerequisites for the exploit:

If you’re using Tomcat and a vulnerable version of Spring, you pretty much have a problem, and should be patching now, Here are the pre-requirements for the current exploit to work on the target system:

- JDK 9 or higher
- Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container.
- Packaged as a traditional WAR (in contrast to a Spring Boot executable jar).
- spring-webmvc or spring-webflux dependency.
- Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 to 5.3.17, 5.2.0 to 5.2.19, and older versions.
> However, its said that the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it that have not been reported yet.


## Severity

The Severity is __CRITICAL__, Click the following [Link to CVSS-v3](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  to have a indepth look at how this vulnerability effects the CIA of the target system.


## Is your Application Build Upon Spring Framework?

This quick grep search can help you identify if your application is built upon the spring framework, This is not the proper way to make sure you are completely safe against the vulnerability but will help you to have a starting point to get started in investigating this issue.

- Unzip the war package: 

- Now go to the decompressed Directory and execute the following command to find any file which matches the `spring-beans-*.jar` pattern. If the grep returns any results it indicates that the business system is developed using the Spring framework.

```python3

### Running the Exploit

The amazing group of members are Lunasec developed a Java Web Application that is vulnerable to the Spring4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2022-22965), The Application is dockerized so that it can be easily implemented, The Application was built based on the tutorials provided on the official Documentation of Spring for [Form Handling](https://spring.io/guides/gs/handling-form-submission/).

Github Link: https://github.com/lunasec-io/Spring4Shell-POC


__How to Setup the Lab:__

- Clone the repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/lunasec-io/Spring4Shell-POC.git` in the terminal.
- cd to the cloned reporsitory and Build and run the container: `docker build . -t spring4shell && docker run -p 8080:8080 spring4shell`
- The Vulnerable Application will now be available at http://localhost:8080/helloworld/greeting

![1](/blog/assets/images/15/1.png)


- Now the Copy the exploit code mentioned above and save it as `exploit.py`
- Now go to your terminal and execute the Exploit on Vulnerable url `python3 exploit.py --url http://localhost:8080/helloworld/greeting`

![1](/blog/assets/images/15/2.png)


- On visiting the shell URL which is (http://localhost:8080/shell.jsp?cmd=id
) in my case, and passing any command in `cmd=` argument, You can see you have successfully Achived RCE on the App-Docker-Container.

## Scanning Your Networks

Recently one of the security researchers has built a Nuclei Template to Detect Spring4Shell, This template can be easily run to scan for Spring4Shell on your Networking, routing, or security devices inside your network.

Template Links: https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/cves/2022/CVE-2022-22965.yaml

__How to run a Scan:__

- Download the template in the current dir
- Save all your target IP's or Web Addresses in `urls.txt`
- run `nuclei -list urls.txt -t CVE-2022-22965.yaml`
